# Building Energy Becnhmarking Based on Monthly Energy Data
This repository covers the techniques applicable to monthly building energy use data for building energy benchmarking,  
including time-series decomposition, time-series clustering, trend quantification, and so on (simple disaggregation technique and change-point regression will be added).
