# Building Energy Becnhmarking Based on Monthly Energy Data
This repository covers techniques applicable to monthly building energy use data, particularly for building energy benchmarking. It includes time-series decomposition, time-series clustering, trend quantification, and more (the simplified weather-related energy disaggregation and the change-point regression method will be added).
  
## Requirements
